For deployment
- prefect build ./parameterized_flow.py:etl_parent_flow -n "Parameterized ETL"
 etl_parent_flow is the entry point i.e. the flow command that we will be calling inside parameterized_flow.py
- prefect deployment apply etl_parent_flow-deployment.yaml
to execute flow runs from this deployment, satart an agent that pulls work from the "default" ork queue:
- prefect agent start --work-queue "default"
to build deployment using schedule on the terminal:
- prefect build ./parameterized_flow:etl_parent_flow -n etl2 --cron "0 0 * * *" -a
etl2 is the new name of our deployment, -a tag implies apply, "0 0 * * *" is the schedule time, day, month, year for cron job
